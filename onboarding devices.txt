Assume HIOT device installed, otherwise need to install HIOT
- Device has no deployment associated with HIOT
- Needs to subscribe to a standard channel (e.g. "O" for onboard)
- How does it find an MQTT broker? SRV record in DNS?? Register Coordinator in DNS??
-- SRV "coordinatorlocal.hiot.io" - need to register this on local DNS
- Once connected, device sends UniqueID to Coordinator
- "Empty" device created in Platform
- Roles etc. configured from Platform
- Can automate provisioning based on known device id (e.g. when device with Id x connects push out this config)
- flags in device record to state whether the record is Configured (on the platform) and Provisioned (on the device)
- config pushed to device
- device online...
